const bio = `Mary Elene Wood lives in Oregon with her partner and two cats. She teaches American literature, autobiography, and health humanities at the University of Oregon.

Mary writes literary criticism, memoir, personal essays, and short stories and recently completed a novel that is now out and about looking for a publisher. She has published short fiction and memoir in The Missouri Review, The Capra Review, Club Plum Journal, and Midway Journal.

She's also published personal essays in British Journal of Medical Ethics (under pseudonym Mary E. Ladd--her grandmother's name), and as a chapter in her otherwise academic book Life Writing and Schizophrenia: Encounters at the Edge of Meaning (Brill, 2013).

In addition to Life Writing, she is the author of The Writing on the Wall: Autobiography and the Asylum (University of Illinois Press, 1994), which is still available at the usual outlets. She has also published a number of articles in academic journals on literature and mental health/illness and topics in American literary studies.

One of her greatest teachers was her mother, who lived and struggled with schizophrenia for over three decades.`;
